### `whoami`

<samp>
Greetings. I am r3sen, a developer on a crusade to defend the digital realm. Like King Baldwin IV, I believe in protecting the kingdom against all odds, and in the world of bits and bytes, the threats are relentless. My mission is to understand the methods of the 'dark side' to better fortify the 'light'.

This repository serves as my holocron—a record of my journey as I forge the skills needed to become a guardian of cyberspace. This is the way.

### 🗺️ The Path Ahead: My Roadmap

My training is structured in phases, each building upon the last to achieve mastery.

- 🎯 **Phase I: The Forge (In Progress)**
  - Master Python for scripting, automation, and tool development.
  - Build a deep understanding of core networking principles (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP).
  - **Project:** `Python-Cyber-Forge` - A collection of custom security scripts.

- 🎯 **Phase II: The Web Fortress**
  - Achieve full-stack proficiency (MERN stack, PHP) to understand web applications inside and out.
  - Master the OWASP Top 10 and common web exploitation techniques.

- 🎯 **Phase III: Descend into the Machine**
  - Learn C and Assembly to understand memory management and low-level systems.
  - Begin the study of reverse engineering and vulnerability research.

- 🎯 **Phase IV: The Offensive**
  - Dive into malware analysis and development for ethical purposes.
  - Prepare for and conquer the OSCP certification.

### ⭐ My Study Philosophy & Tips for You

#### 1. The Builder's Mentality
Don't get trapped in "tutorial purgatory." For every concept you learn, **build something**. Watched a video on Python sockets? Write a simple port scanner. Learned about REST APIs? Script something to interact with one. Knowledge is only theory until it's applied.

#### 2. The "Why" Before the "How"
It's easy to learn *how* to run a tool or exploit. It's harder, but infinitely more valuable, to learn *why* it works. Understanding the underlying protocol, code logic, or system flaw is the difference between a script kiddie and a hacker. Always ask "why?".

#### 3. Keep a "Captain's Log"
Document everything you learn. Use a tool like **Obsidian**, **Notion**, or even a private GitHub repo. Take notes on commands, concepts, and especially your failures. A detailed log is the most powerful tool in your arsenal. It shows you how far you've come and prevents you from solving the same problem twice.

#### 4. The T-Shaped Learner
Your roadmap is vast, which is great for ambition. But to avoid burnout, focus on one deep area at a time while keeping your general knowledge broad. Go deep on web hacking for a few months. Then, go deep on networking. This creates a "T" shape of knowledge—broad understanding across the top, with deep expertise in specific verticals.

#### 5. Join the Alliance
You are not alone on this path. Engage with the community on platforms like **TryHackMe**, **Hack The Box**, and security-focused corners of X/Twitter and Discord. Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) events, even if you feel unprepared. The fastest way to learn is by doing and collaborating with others on the same mission.
